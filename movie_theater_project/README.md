A **full-stack web application** for browsing movies, selecting showtimes, choosing seats, and making bookings.  
The system integrates **Django REST Framework** on the backend with a **React frontend**, and stores data in **PostgreSQL**.  
It provides a modern, mobile-friendly interface and is designed to simulate a realistic theater booking flow.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project replicates the core features of a real-world movie theater platform. Users can register, log in, browse available movies, check showtimes, select seats in real time, and confirm or cancel bookings. Additional features include **reviews, watchlists, notifications, and an analytics dashboard for admins**.  

From the start, the project was designed to go beyond earlier CS50W assignments. Unlike the commerce or social network projects, this system focuses on **scheduling and seat-level booking integrity**, which required careful API design, state management, and real-time validation.

The stack also incorporates **Celery with Redis for background tasks** (e.g., sending booking notifications), **Docker Compose for containerization**, and **GitHub Actions for CI/CD**, making the system robust, scalable, and production-ready.

## ‚ú® Features

- **User Authentication**
  - Register, log in, and log out with Django sessions and CSRF protection.
  - Secure access to bookings and profiles.

- **Movies and Showtimes**
  - Browse movies with details like title, description, runtime, posters, and trailers.
  - View showtimes by date, time, available seats, language, and auditorium.
  - Advanced search and filtering by title, genre, release date, or showtime.

- **Seat Selection and Booking**
  - Interactive seat maps with real-time availability checks.
  - Server-side validation to prevent double-booking.
  - Full booking flow: confirmation, cancellation, and payment simulation.

- **User Dashboard**
  - Manage bookings, reviews, and watchlists.
  - Update or cancel bookings as allowed.
  - Add/remove movies from watchlists and favorites.
  - Create, edit, or delete reviews; rate service post-showtime.
- **News Section**
  - Announcements for upcoming movies, releases, and events.

- **Admin Features**
  - Django Admin for managing movies, showtimes, and bookings.
  - Dashboard with KPIs: revenue, utilization, users, and bookings.
  - Role-based permissions (e.g., users edit only their reviews).

- **Notifications & Background Tasks**
  - Signals trigger notifications for watchlist updates or favorite releases.
  - Celery tasks handle reminders, pending booking alerts, unpaid cancellations, and post-showtime feedback.

- **Responsive Design**
  - Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Distinctiveness and Complexity

This project is **distinct** from other CS50W assignments in both concept and implementation.  

It is **not a social network** (like Project 4), since it focuses on theater operations, scheduling, and ticketing rather than user relationships (users can't see other users' activities).  
It is **not an e-commerce site** (like Project 2), since it doesn‚Äôt use a shopping cart model; instead, it handles real-time seat maps, showtime scheduling, and validation for bookings‚Äîcloser to airline/train reservation systems than to product checkout flows.  

In terms of **complexity**, the project required solving challenges beyond earlier projects:
- **Frontend + Backend Integration:** React for interactive UI, Django REST Framework for APIs.  
- **Real-Time Seat Validation:** Concurrency-safe checks to prevent race conditions.  
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery for notifications and background processes.  
- **Interconnected Models:** Complex schema for Movies, Showtimes, Bookings, Users, Reviews, etc.  
- **Scalability:** Dockerized setup, CI/CD pipeline, and cloud deployment.  

These elements ensure the project is not only distinct from the course‚Äôs prior projects but also reflects real-world engineering complexity.
